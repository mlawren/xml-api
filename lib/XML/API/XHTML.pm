=head1 NAME

XML::API::XHTML - XHTML generation through an object API

=head1 VERSION

0.28 (yyyy-mm-dd)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

As a simple example the following perl code:

  use XML::API::XHTML;
  my $x = new XML::API::XHTML();
  
  $x->head_open();
  $x->title('Test Page');
  $x->head_close();

  $x->body_open();
  $x->div_open({id => 'content'});
  $x->p('A test paragraph');
  $x->div_close();
  $x->body_close();

  $x->_print;

will produce the following nicely rendered output:
  
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Test Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="content">
        <p>A test paragraph</p>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>

There are more complicated and flexible ways to use this module. Read on.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<XML::API::XHTML> is a perl object class for creating XHTML documents. The
methods of a B<XML::API::XHTML> object are derived directly from the XHTML
specification. A document author uses the methods to define the structure
and content of their document, which can then be printed and sent somewhere
or saved as desired.

The first step is to create an object:

  use XML::API::XHTML;
  my $x = new XML::API::XHTML();

$x is the only object we need for our entire XHTML document. By default
$x consists initially of only the root element ('html') which should be
thought of as the 'current' or 'containing' element. The next step might
be to add a 'head' element. We do this by calling the head_open() method:

  $x->head_open();

Because we have called a *_open() function all further elements will be
added inside the 'head' element. So lets add the title element and the title
itself ('Document Title') to our object:

  $x->title('Document Title');

The 'title()' method on its own (ie not 'title_open()') indicates that we
are finished with the title element. Further methods will
continue to place elements inside the 'head' element until we specifiy
we want to move on by calling the _close method:

  $x->head_close();

We are now back inside the 'html' element.

So, basic elements seem relatively easy. How do we create elements with
attributes? When either the element() or element_open() methods are called
with a hashref argument the keys and values of the hashref become the
attributes:

  $x->body_open({id => 'bodyid'}, 'Content', 'more content');

By the way, both the element() and element_open() methods take arbitrary
numbers of content arguments as shown above. However if you don't want to
specify the content of the element at the time you open it up you can
use the _add() utility method later on:

  $x->div_open();
  $x->_add('Content added afterwards');

The final thing is to close out the elements and render our docment.
It is not strictly necessary to close out all elements, but consider it
good practice.

  $x->div_close();
  $x->body_close();
  print $x->_as_string();

=head1 SCHEMA CONFORMANCE

If you attempt to call a method that would create a document that doesn't
conform to the schema an error will be printed to STDERR and the method
will fail.

=head1 METHODS

B<XML::API::XHTML> inherits directly from B<XML::API> and actually provides
no methods of its own. All utility methods (new(), _print(), _add etc)
and advanced functionality such as adding content in a non-linear fashion
are base properties of B<XML::API> and users are directed there
for details. The important B<XML::API> methods are only summarised
here for convenience.

=head2 B<new()>

All elements of the XHTML specification (with the exception of 'html')
are available as the following function forms:

  $x->element_open({attribute => $value}, $content)

  $x->element({attribute => $value}, $content)

  $x->element_close({attribute => $value}, $content)


This module has no control functions of its own. See the documentation for
L<XML::API> for useful functions (such as _print).


=head2 EXPORT

None.

=head2 REQUIRES

Perl5.6.0, Carp, XML::API

=head1 SEE ALSO

XML::API and XML::API::XHTML were both written
for the Rekudos framework which is housed at http://rekudos.net/.
